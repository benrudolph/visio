# Selected Data

These are the models for the datum that is selected on a figure. Mainly the datum needs to keep track of 3 things:

* The year of the datum (usually the dashboard year)
* The reported type, either MYR or YER
* ID parameter tree to know how to find the datum

With these 3 things it's possible to find the narratives related to the datum/parameter.
